PyNeuron-Toolbox
================

The [NEURON simulation environment](http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) is one of the most popular options for simulating multi-compartment neuron models. [Hines et al. (2009)](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/neuro.11.001.2009/abstract) developed a module that allowed users to execute simulations from python. This option appears to be very popular with users.

However, much of the data analysis capabilities of NEURON (e.g. [shape plots](http://www.oberlin.edu/OCTET/HowTo/NEURON/B2_RealisticMorph.html)) are still limited to the traditional environment in [hoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoc_(programming_language)). This python module provides some functions to do data analysis in matplotlib.
